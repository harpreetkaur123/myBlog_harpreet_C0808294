                    Protection and Privacy
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The terms data protection and data privacy are often used interchangeably, 
                    but there is an important difference between the two. Data privacy defines 
                    who has access to data, while data protection provides tools and policies to
                     actually restrict access to the data. Compliance regulations help ensure that
                      userâ€™s privacy requests are carried out by companies, and companies are
                       responsible to take measures to protect private user data and companies are
                       responsible to take measures.

                    Why Is it Important?
                </h3>
                <p class="ps">
                    Data privacy concerns apply to all sensitive information that organizations handle,
                     including that of customers, shareholders, and employees. Often, this information 
                     plays a vital role in business operations, development, and finances.

Data privacy helps ensure that sensitive data is only accessible to approved parties. It prevents 

criminals from being able to maliciously use data and helps ensure that organizations meet regulatory 
requirements.

Data privacy is enforced by data protection regulations. Non-compliance may result in monetary fines
 or loss of brand authority.
